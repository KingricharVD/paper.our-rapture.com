RELEASE ZIP: https://github.com/RaptureCore/paper.our-rapture.com/archive/v1.0.0-rapture.zip

Would you like to get started with Rapture – perhaps as an investment, gift, payment, or donation – but don’t want to install anything on your computer right now? A Rapture paper wallet is a great solution!
A paper wallet is perfect for long term storage of cryptocurrency, because it is NOT connected to the internet – and is considered “cold storage” – meaning, it’s unhackable. By using common sense strategies, it’s easy to keep a paper wallet safe – in the same way you keep your cash and any fine jewelry or other valuables safe!

For best printing results:
Use a LASER printer (inkjet prints are more vulnerable to water damage).
Use of Chrome browser is recommended, print at 100% scale. For other browsers, printing at 95% scale may give better results.

NOTE: for nominal amounts of cryptocurrency, or to “just get started out” – it’s ok to print a paper wallet from a trusted online wallet generator. In the case of storing larger amounts of cryptocurrency, it is highly recommended to follow the steps below for maximum security.

PAPER WALLET PRINTING TUTORIAL
Follow these instructions for maximum paper wallet security
—
1. Go offline
Your computer may be vulnerable to “spies” when you are generating the keys and printing them out (for example, if your computer has malware). The most important safety measure is to download the javascript wallet generator to your computer, then  go offline and generate your wallet WHILE OFFLINE.

2. CLEANING UP – deleting those pesky cache files
The problem with printing out secure documents—even if your computer is 100% virus/trojan free—is that your printer driver and/or operating system may be keeping copies of the documents you print in some sort of “spool” or print queue. If a hacker or virus gets into your computer and knows to look for these cache files, then they can get your private keys and “sweep” your wallets. Here are some tips on how to securely delete your printer “spool” files (from bitcoinpaperwallet.com)

Macintosh:

Enable ‘FileVault’ to encrypt your filesystem so that cache files cannot be ‘undeleted’.
Set up a symbolic link from /private/var/spool/cups/cache/ to a removable media volume (e.g. a SD card) and disconnect it when not in use.
Windows:

Use an encrypted filesystem so that your cache files cannot be ‘undeleted’.
Read this FAQ from bitcoinpaperwallet.com on how to change the destination of your cache (spool) files to removable media.
Linux:

Use a live-boot CD instead of a regular hard drive OS install. This way when you reboot your computer, all cache files are deleted from memory and no jobs are ever written to disk.

3. Use a “clean machine”
If you’ve got loads of applications on your computer, or if you use your computer for “risky behavior” (like installing freeware or visiting java / flash websites) consider dedicating a computer (or at least a bootable partition / thumbdrive / “live CD”) for paper wallet printing. Never take that install online. Transfer the wallet generator ZIP file from GitHub to your clean OS using a thumbdrive or other non-networked method. (credit: bitcoinpaperwallet.com)

4. Use an “old-fangled” printer (aka “dumb” printer)
Some advanced printers have internal storage (even hard drives) that preserve copies of printouts. This is a risk if someone gets access to your printer, or if you dispose of your printer. There is also the possibility that a smart enough printer can be hacked. This isn’t quite tinfoil-hat level paranoia, as we’ve seen examples in the wild of viruses that rewrite the firmware of non-computer devices indirectly connected to the Internet. If this concerns you, don’t use a fancy printer, and never let your printer have access to the Internet or to an Internet-connected computer. (credit: bitcoinpaperwallet.com)
